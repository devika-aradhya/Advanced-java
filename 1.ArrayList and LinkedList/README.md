ArrayList and LinkedList Programs

[1.a Develop a Java program for adding elements [Apple, Banana, Orange] into an ArrayList
and a LinkedList to perform the following operations with different functions directed as
follows
1. Adding elements, 2. Adding element at specific index, 3. Adding multiple elements, 4.
Accessing elements,5. Updating elements, 6. Removing elements, 7. Searching elements, 8. List
size, 9. Iterating over list, 10. Using Iterator, 11. Sorting, 12. Sublist, 13. Clearing the list
1b. Array List programs]

[1. Write a java program for getting different colors through ArrayList interface and search whether
the color "Red" is available or not]


Solution->(https://github.com/devika-aradhya/Advanced-java/blob/main/1.ArrayList%20and%20LinkedList/1b.Searchcolor.png)



[2. Write a java program for getting different colors through ArrayList interface and remove the
2nd element and color "Blue" from the ArrayList]


Solution->(https://github.com/devika-aradhya/Advanced-java/blob/main/1.ArrayList%20and%20LinkedList/1b2RemoveColors.png)


[4. Write a java program for getting different colors through ArrayList interface and sort them
using Collections.sort( ArrayListObj)]



[5. Write a java program for getting different colors through ArrayList interface and extract the
elements 1st and 2nd from the ArrayList object by using SubList()]

Solution->()


[6. Write a java program for getting different colors through ArrayList interface and delete nth
element from the ArrayList object by using remove by index]

Solution->()

1c. Linked List Programs

[1. Write a Java program to iterate through all elements in a linked list starting at the
specified position ( 2nd) using iterator ( hint : Iterator iteratorobj = listobj.listIterator(1))]

Solution->()


[2. Write a Java program to iterate a linked list in reverse order (using
objlist.descendingIterator())]

Solution->()


[3. Write a Java program to insert the specified element at the end of a linked list.( using
l_listobj.offerLast("Pink"))]

Solution->()


[4. Write a Java program to display elements and their positions in a linked list ( using
l_listobj.get(p) )]

Solution->()


[5. Write a Java program that swaps two elements ( first and third elements ) in a linked list ( using
Collections.swap(l_list, 0, 2))]

Solution->()
