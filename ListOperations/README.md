1a.ListOperations:[ Develop a Java program for adding elements [Apple, Banana, Orange] into an ArrayList
and a LinkedList to perform the following operations with different functions directed as
follows
1. Adding elements, 2. Adding element at specific index, 3. Adding multiple elements, 4.
Accessing elements,5. Updating elements, 6. Removing elements, 7. Searching elements, 8. List
size, 9. Iterating over list, 10. Using Iterator, 11. Sorting, 12. Sublist, 13. Clearing the list]

1b. Array List programs:
[1. Write a java program for getting different colors through ArrayList interface and search whether
the color "Red" is available or not]
solution->(https://github.com/devika-aradhya/Advanced-java/blob/main/ListOperations/SearchColor.java)
[2. Write a java program for getting different colors through ArrayList interface and remove the
2nd element and color "Blue" from the ArrayList]
Solution->()
[3.Write a java program for getting different colors through ArrayList interface and sort them
using Collections.sort( ArrayListObj)]
Solution->()
[4.Write a java program for getting different colors through ArrayList interface and extract the
elements 1st and 2nd from the ArrayList object by using SubList()]
Solution->()
[5.Write a java program for getting different colors through ArrayList interface and delete nth
element from the ArrayList object by using remove by index]
Solution->()
